    <em>...here is a bowl of well prepared potato soup ready for consumption.</em><br>
<div><h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Peeled and diced Russet potatoes</li>
        <li>Chopped yellow onion</li>
        <li>Peeled and diced carrots</li>
        <li>Diced celery </li>
        <li>Low-sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>butter</li>
        <li>All-purpose flour</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Sour Cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine diced potatoes, carrots, celery and onions with chicken broth in a large pot and season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Cover pot and bring to a boil over medium-high heat (it will take about 10 minutes to reach a boil).</li>
        <li>Once it reaches a boil reduce heat to medium and continue to cook about 15 - 20 minutes longer until potatoes are very soft when pierced with a fork.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan melt butter over medium heat, add flour and cook for 1 minute while whisking constantly. While whisking, slowly add milk and cook, stirring constantly until mixture begins thicken.</li>
        <li>Once potatoes are soft add thickened milk mixture to potato soup mixture and stir (potatoes should start breaking down into soup).</li>
        <li>Add sour cream and mix well.</li>
        <li>Ladle soup into serving bowls, top each serving with bacon or ham, cheddar cheese and green onions.</li>
